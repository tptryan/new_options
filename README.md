### new_options: 
A Rails Application created for the purpose of experimenting with new Rails Application configuration options.

* Option Used for Configuration
```

For the configuration of this application, two options were used, "-T" and "-j." The "-T" option skips test of unit files. The "-j"  preconfigures the application for selected JavaScript library. These were the only options used, although there are many other configuration options available.
